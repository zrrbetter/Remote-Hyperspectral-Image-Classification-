# Remote-Hyperspectral-Image-Classification
Introduce what I learn, find and explore. Share some opinions and insights. Put forward some related questions. 
Hope us have a many breakthroughs and creations in this fileds.


Some papers derserved read:
1„ÄÅU2ConvFormer: Marrying and Evolving Nested U-Net and Scale-Aware Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Classification
Proposed three creations including:
(1)The nested U-net structure can fully extract and aggregate multiscale spectral-spectral-spatial features at both inter and -inner 
stage granularity.
(2)The sacale-aware Transformer takes multiscale local spectral-spatial features from the encoder of nested U-net and produces multiscale 
global spectral-spatial features for its decoder.
(3)Design a novel plug-and-play searchable operation called asymmetric spectral-spatial convolution(A2SConv),where asymmetric spetral-spatial 
feature pooling and multiscale extraction can be concurrrently searched.
